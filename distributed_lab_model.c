/*
find the growth in national consumption for five years
using Distributed Lag Model given below:
I = 2 + 0.1 Y-1
Y = 45.45 + 2.27 (I +G)
T = 0.2 Y
C = 20 + 0.7 ( Y â€“ T )
Assume the initial value of Y-1 is 80 and take the governmental expenditure in
the 5 years to be as follows:
Year    G
1       20
2       25
3       30
4       35
5       40
